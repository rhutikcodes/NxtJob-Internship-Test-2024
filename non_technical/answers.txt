1. How do you stay updated on software development topics and remain active in the community? (Forums/Discord/Slack/Meetups/Twitter/Blogs)
-> I watch Twitch streams and YouTube videos of The-Primegen, Theo, and along with that I follow the Hacker News, as it updates frequently, in addition to that I have followed some very great people on X(Twitter) they too give me updates.

2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
-> Ide I most used are- VS Code and neovim or nvim,sometimes I use WebStorm too.. Shortcuts that I used the most include the too common (copy, paste) kidding, I have bonded my own shortcuts to (duplicate the line down, in neovim I use fuzzy finder and split buffers alot).  

3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
-> I follow the SDLC rule I had learned about in college, it includes: 
   - Planning & Analysis of requirements
   - Stating the requirements, in all aspects
   - Designing the whole system
   - Development & Coding
   - Thorough testing
   - Deployment(Release) and Maintenance ( Fixing Bugs)   

   This is my approach to any type of development in general, not only specifically backend.

4. How do you ensure that your frontend code is functional and reliable? What are your favourite testing methods and tools?

-> In particular I don't know a lot about the frontend, but I check for some bugs and responsiveness of frontend, Tools that I use are, inspect element of browser and React dev tools for react projects. Also there are n number of online tools available.
